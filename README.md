# Time-Tracker
#Overview
Keeps track of time and who attended the meetings, kind of is the job of secretary.

#Background / Usuage
Had to keep track of time and who attended meetings because of the project manager status of our senior design project. Did not want to use a bunch of paper so created a program that kept the time and attendance and saved it to a file. You can also load the file from previous meetings
