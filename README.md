# Time-Tracker
# Overview
Keeps track of time and who attended the meetings, kind of is the job of secretary.

# Background / Usuage
Had to keep track of time and who attended meetings because of the project manager status of our senior design project. Did not want to use a bunch of paper so created a program that kept the time and attendance and saved it to a file. You can also load the file from previous meetings

# System
Have used in Qt only and worked on windows, in theory should still work on linux and apple machines. Need to have Qt 4.8 or higher installed on the host computer.

# How to run
Download the zip of the project and create a folder for the project. Once that is downloaded and the folder is created, move the contents into the folder and open the TimeTracker.pro in QT, configure, build and run the project. It will guide you through how to configure it in QT. Once it is done building, a window will pop up with GUI.
